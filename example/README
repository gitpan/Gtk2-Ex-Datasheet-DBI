This is a simple test application to show you how to use Gtk2::Ex::Datasheet::DBI

You will have to start out by creating a database and populating it with the tables that is used.
The 'datasheet.sql' file is a mysqldump of this table. Create your database:

    mysql> create database datasheet;

Then import the data:

    mysql datasheet < /path/to/datasheet.sql -p

Then edit the test_datasheet.pl script and enter your username / password  ( and maybe dbserver ) in the LoadForm() sub.

You should then be able to run the example.

If you have an old database from a previous example, delete it and re-create it.
