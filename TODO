Things, to do, in order of priority:

- Support custom functions for colour formatting cells?
    - Too processor-intensive?
    - Trigger from process_xxx_editing subs?

- What's up with CellRenderSpinButton? It's been broken for quite a while now ...

- Support non-db-server usage, such as SQLite ( doesn't support $dbh->column_info )

- Figure out what's up with blocking the size_allocate signal
