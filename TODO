Things, to do, in order of priority:

- *** Fix data entry issue: clicking outside treeview immediately after editing looses last edit ***
-  *** CellRendererCombo ( bug reported - waiting on reply )
-  *** MOFO::CellRendererText ( don't know how to do this - revert to standard? )

- Add record paging similar to Gtk2::Ex::DBI for huge results
    - How do we do this?

- Support detecting primary keys for more DB servers

- Support custom functions for colour formatting cells?
    - Too processor-intensive?
    - Trigger from process_xxx_editing subs?

- What's up with CellRenderSpinButton? It's been broken for quite a while now ...

- Support non-db-server usage, such as SQLite ( doesn't support $dbh->column_info )

- Figure out what's up with blocking the size_allocate signal
