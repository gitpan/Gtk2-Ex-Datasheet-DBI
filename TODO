Things, to do, in order of priority:


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to complete before releasing this version ...

- Check make test and cpan stuff

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Changes for a later version ...

- Create a 'date' definition hash, similar to the number definition hash
	- Call builtin_render_functions internally, but remove references to this in documentation
	- Make sure date definition hash matches the one from Gtk2::Ex::DBI

-  *** CellRendererTime - 1st use doesn't receive cell data ( all successive uses do )

- Set up dynamic width columns in 'flying blind' mode.

- Support italic formatting of cells
    I've never wanted it myself, but it should be in for completeness ...

- Push customer cell renderers out into another project :) Maybe Gtk2::Ex
    They would be handy for other people to use. Maybe they're already there? Investigate

- Add support for calculated fields
	- Already supported via custom_render_function ??? Investigate with some test cases

- Enforce database field definitions for char, varchar length

- Add record paging similar to Gtk2::Ex::DBI for huge results
    - How do we do this?

- Support detecting primary keys for more DB servers

- Watch for support for the new CellRendererSpinButton, which has just made it into Gtk2 stock :)

- Figure out what's up with blocking the size_allocate signal
