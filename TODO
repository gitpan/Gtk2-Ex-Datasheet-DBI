Things, to do, in order of priority:

- Editing behaviour that doesn't suck
    Gtk2's default behaviour for editing cells in a TreeView is jaw-droppingly bad
    Need to add sensible behaviour on receiving the following keys:
        - TAB
        - ENTER
        - CURSOR
    This is proving to be more difficult than I'd hoped
    
- Add support for a custom CellRendererSpinButton for numeric values

- Remove requirement of defining each field ( partially done )
    eg You could just set up a query: 'select * from table' and not define any fields
    This would make a good database explorer - you could create a browser for all the tables in a database
    and select to open one in datasheet mode ... I suppose this is already possible, but with the extra work
    of setting up the field names based on the table

- Figure out what's up with blocking the size_allocate signal
